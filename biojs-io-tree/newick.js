 * Example tree (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format):
 *
 * +--0.1--A
 * F-----0.2-----B            +-------0.3----C
 * +------------------0.5-----E
 *                            +---------0.4------D
 *
 * Newick format:
 * (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F;
 *
 * Converted to JSON:
 * {
 *   name: "F",
 *   children: [
 *     {name: "A", branch_length: 0.1},
 *     {name: "B", branch_length: 0.2},
 *     {
 *       name: "E",
 *       length: 0.5,
 *       children: [
 *         {name: "C", branch_length: 0.3},
 *         {name: "D", branch_length: 0.4}
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 *
 * Converted to JSON, but with no names or lengths:
 * {
 *   children: [
 *     {}, {}, {
 *       children: [{}, {}]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
