# bug fix: {*}.find("SMILES",smilesString) does not include aromatic H
# bug fix: Smiles MF calculation for aromatic atoms N and C in error.
#    NOTE: Jmol may undercount the number of hydrogen atoms
#          for aromatic amines where the ring bonding to N is 
#          not explicit. Each "n" will be assigned a bonding count
#          of two unless explicitly indicated as -n-.
#          Thus, we take the position that "n" is the 
#          N of pyridine unless otherwise indicated.
#         
#          For example:
#            $ print "c1ncccc1C".find("SMILES","MF")
#            H 7 C 5 N 1   (correct)
#            $ print "c1nc-n-c1C".find("SMILES","MF")
#            H 6 C 4 N 2   (correct)
#          but
#            $ print "c1ncnc1C".find("SMILES","MF")
#            H 5 C 4 N 2   (incorrect)

# bug fix: load "" does not work after loading a SET of models using load DATA
# bug fix: CIF reader cannot read files with _space_group_symop_operation_xyz field
# bug fix: naming functions or variables after Jmol token names fails or acts unexpectedly
#          (fixing this bug required script compiler changes, and that lead to the
#           two new features below)
#
# bug fix: "var chains" does not work -- i.e. a name of a "within" option. 
#          solution was to allow var ANYTHING.
#
# bug fix: User variables and functions removed from state because they are 
#          no longer necessary and also indeterminant in terms of the "state".
#          Originally these were needed because ECHO and DEFINE can be dynamic
#          -- which is still true -- and because certain commands such as ISOSURFACE
#          were being saved in the state just as their strings instead of their 
#          intepreted code. But that was changed for 12.0, and this fix also changes 
#          ECHO to be saved in its current state, not its dynamic state. While 
#          dynamic DEFINE types may include variables, they aren't really
#          part of the "state" per se and aren't needed to recreate the state. So
#          they are dropped from the state with this fix as well. 
#
# new feature: function calls can look like Jmol commands (also added to 12.1.16):
#      function myfunc(a, b, c, d){....}
#      myfunc a b c d
#      -- these are MATHEMATICAL commands 
#      -- use just a b, not @a @b
#
# new feature: custom overloading of Jmol commands (also added to 12.1.16)
#      function measure(a, b) { print "measuring " + a + " " + b; measure @a @b }
#      measure {atomno=2} {atomno=3}
#      -- within function X, command X is standard Jmol; 
#      -- outside the function, it is a reference to that function
#      -- overloaded functions are not saved in the state
#
# new feature: load xxx.pdb filter "CONF 1" does a front-end filter of just
#          the first alt-loc atoms within a given residue. This leads to proper
#          formation of polymers in certain cases (2BLN, 2CI1). (necessary for DSSP)

# bug fix: cartoon helix in 1TF6 broken by DSSP HHHGGG run
# bug fix: not loading MOL files having no bonds

# Implemented here is a flexible way of mapping atomic potential data onto 
# a surface. Given a set of atoms, we assign numbers to the atoms from:
# 
# a) a resource in this package and based on atom names, or
# b) a table of data read from a file and based on atom names, or
# c) an array of properties assigned to the atoms. 
# 
# In addition, once those potentials are assigned, we can apply a variety 
# of functions of distance:
# 
# (0)   Coulomb's law distance function (same as rasmol potential distance function)
# (1)   f * e^(-d/2)

# The difference between MEP and MLP is simply the defaults for resource and function:

# a) the default resource is property partialCharge for MEP and atomicLipophilicity.txt for MLP
# b) the default function is Coulomb for MEP and Fauchere for MLP

# SMILES/SMARTS options summary:
#
# examples:
#
# selecting atoms using SMARTS:
#
# select search("CC")               // selects ALL matching atoms  using SMARTS notation
# select search("CC", 1.1)          // same as above, but within model 1.1
# select smarts("CC")               // would match ethane, exclusively
#
# assigning variables based on SMARTS:
#
# x = {1.1}.find("CC")              // assigns a single bitset to all matching atoms
# x = {1.1}.find("CC", true)        // same as above, but returns an array of pattern matches
# n = {1.1}.find("CC", true).length // counts the number of matches
#
# SMILES string comparison and searching:
#
# x = "CC(C)CC".find("smiles","CCC(C)C")    // smiles matching -- returns an array of length=1
# x = "CC(C)CC".find("smarts","CCCC")       // returns a bitset containing all atoms
# x = "CC(C)CC".find("smarts","CCCC", true) // returns an array of bitsets containing the pattern
#
# generating SMILES and bioSMILES strings:
#
# x = {1.1}.find("SMILES")          // get the SMILES string for the model 1.1
# x = {1.1}.find("SMILES", true)    // get the bioSMILES string for the model 1.1

# - use select search(...) to do SMARTS substructure searching
# - use the find function to assign variables.
# - use TRUE with the find function to retrieve and count matches
# - use find(..).length to count the number of matches
# - use find to get the SMILES or bioSMILES string for a structure

# deprecated/unnecessary:

# select substructure("..")         // same as  select smarts(...
# select within(smarts...)          // same as  select smarts(...
# select within(smiles...)          // same as  select smiles(..., but not recommended
# x = within("smarts", "CC")        // same as {*}.find("CC")  REMOVED in RC25
# x = within("smiles", "CC")        // same as {*}.find("smiles", "CC") REMOVED in RC25

# bug fix: SMILES errors should be reported but not cause script failure
# bug fix: select within("smarts","Cn",all,atomno=19) does not properly 
#          restrict set to only those patterns that include atomno=19
# bug fix: select substructure(...) now synonymous with select SMARTS(), not select SMILES()
#                 as would be expected for substructure searches.  
# bug fix: modelkit connection doesn't modify bonds automatically
# new feature: assign CONNECT {a} {b}  
#           -- does a simple connection, but then,
#              like assign atom and assign bond, fixes hydrogens

# bug fix: isosurface sigma x.x not properly implemented
#          "sigma 3.0" means "3.0 times the cutoff associated with sigma = 1.0"

# bug fix: simple model appended to model having unit cell does not show axes

# code: generalized d/f orbital order reading
# bug fix: WebMO f-orbital order fix
#
# new feature: invertSelected STEREO {center} {atomsToInvert}
#
#   Does a rotation of 180 degrees around a center about a line connecting
#   the center and the geometric center of any connected atoms not in the
#   list to invert. The results is the standard organic chemist's 
#   "stereochemical inversion" at that point -- which does not 
#   invert stereochemistry along the branches.
#
# bug fix: set minimizationCriterion, set minimizationRefresh, set minimizationSteps
# code: matrix3f/matrix4f JmolScript improvements
# bug fix: load "@x" loads model twice when the saved state is restored

#
# new feature: function compare({bitset1} or [{positions1}],{bitset2} or [{positions2}])
#
#   Takes either two sets of atoms or two arrays of atom positions
#   and returns a 4x4 matrix m indicating the rotation (m%1) and translation (m%2)
#   required to BEST transform set 1 into set 2. Unlike the COMPARE command,
#   No filtering is done -- every atom or position in set1 is compared with every 
#   position in set2. Optional third parameter "stddev" allows return of just 
#   the RMSD for this comparison. For example:
#
#     m = compare({2.1 and spine and 92-100}, {1.1 and spine and 27-35})
#
# new feature: %1 and %2 modulus for Matrix4:
#
#     m4%1 (rotation matrix)
#     m4%2 (translation vector)
#
#   (Note that quaternion(m4%1) then returns a quaternion equivalent of the
#   rotation matrix.)
#
# new feature: rotate [selected] COMPARE {bitset1} or [{positions1}],{bitset2} or [{positions2}]
#
#   Compares the atom positions or coordinate arrays and moves either
#   the selected atoms or the current view. So, for example:
#
#     tempcoord = {2.1}.xyz
#     compare 2 {2.1} {1.1} ROTATE TRANSLATE
#     [...later]
#     select {2.1}; rotate selected COMPARE {2.1} @tempcoord -2 
#
#   Over the course of 2 seconds ("2" would mean 2 degrees per second)
#   the atom positions of model 2.1 will be moved back to their original
#   positions that they had prior to the compare operation.
#   
# new feature: rotate [SELECTED] TRANSLATE {x y z} [extent] [rate]
#   
#   same as TRANSLATE {x y z} (SELECTED is implied), but allows for
#   an animation of the process. When not combined with a rotation,
#   the optional extent is in Angstroms and rate is in AngstromsPerSecond, 
#   otherwise extent is in degrees and rate is in degreesPerSecond.
#
# new feature: rotate [SELECTED] [HELIX] (matrix variable)
#
#   Allows rotation and translation by a 4x4 matrix. The optional
#   parameter HELIX moves the atoms along the optimal helical path.
#   For example: 
#
#     x = compare({2.1 and spine and 92-100}, {1.1 and spine and 27-35})
#     select 2.1
#     rotate selected @x -3
#
# new feature: compare nSeconds ...
#
#   Animates the compare move over a number of seconds.
#
# bug fix: compare ORIENTATION can give spurious result

# default atom size changed from 20%Jmol to 23%Auto for C atom size match in small molecules
#
# new feature: update of Babel VDW forces. We had been using Babel 1.0 numbers
#  that were changed long ago; 
# new feature: set defaultVDW BABEL21  -- older 2.1 numbers previously "BABEL"
#
# bug fix: MAJOR -- proper model-based Van der Waals radii.
#   this bug has been with Jmol since its inception -- that
#   the inflated Jmol parameters for H, C, N, and O  are not
#   proper for anything but traditional "no hydrogen" PDB files
#   That "Jmol" data set should not be used with small molecules,
#   and it has long been noted that it looks incorrect. While we
#   have had the (old) Babel data set, one should not have to 
#   know to use that manually. The new feature associated with this
#   fix is
#
#      set defaultVDW AUTO (default)
#
#   So now Jmol will apply a proper Babel-based VDW set when 
#   the file has hydrogen atoms present. One can always override this
#   if desired, but I think the only reason to do that is to have
#   the identical match to an improperly defined VDW size in previous 
#   output. 
#
#   Note -- script files already in place will not be affected, 
#   as they explicitly define defaultVDW to be JMOL.

# bug fix: GAMESS reader not reading BETA MOs.
# bug fix: A function starting with "_" originally was considered 
#          local to the applet, with all other functions being static.
#          Then, in 11.7.45, this was switched. Unfortunately,
#          that meant state functions _set... were static
#          causing applet-applet interference.
#          So for this fix I've changed that to be "static_..." for 
#          expressly static functions, and then also designated
#          "_...." functions as not generally declared when writing
#          a state or in "show functions" so that a state does not 
#          duplicate itself, and "show functions" works as before.

#
# OK, this version basically turns Jmol scripting language into a subset of JavaScript. 
# Or, maybe a superset of the basic JavaScript constructs. Anyway, they are related.
#
# Similarities to JavaScript:
#
# --Jmol scripting now supports ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=, \=, |=, &=
# --The if, for, while, and function constructs are all about the same, using braces. 
#   for example:
#
#     for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {print {*}[i].radius}
#     for (i = 0; ++i <= 10;) {print {*}[i].temperature}
#     if (var i < 10) {{*}[i].radius *= 2} else {spacefill off;wireframe}
#     i = 0; while (++i < 10) {select {*}[i * 2]; color red }
#
# --A relatively free typing of variables. Jmol is going to save variables as strings 
#   in terms of the Jmol "state" but in this version I introduce the Variable class that
#   subclasses Token and allows for a more organized approach to variables and sets the 
#   stage for future improvements. 
# --Commands separated by semicolons or line breaks
# --Object-like methods and fields such as {*}.xyz.all.join(" ") and {atomno=3}.radius
# --On-the-fly compilation.
#
# Differences include:
#
# --A broarder range of variable types, including boolean, integer, decimal, 
#   string, point, axis-angle/plane/quaternion, atom bitset, bond bitset, 
#   and one-dimensional array.
# --No case-sensitivity for variable names. 
# --1-based rather than 0-based arrays. (ONLY because that's the way models are numbered.)
# --Array indexing from the back to the front using n <= 0: A[0] A[-1] A[-2].
# --Array ranges [n][m], for example A[-3][0]
# --Core commands do not use commas or parentheses.
# --Visual-Basic-like IF / ELSEIF /END IF, FOR/END FOR, WHILE /END WHILE, and GOTO options.
# --A broad range of mathematical operations  
# --Of course, a whole suite of methods that relate to molecular structure.

#  CANNOT be combined with the JAVASCRIPT command. This is because
#  in that environment, the JAVASCRIPT command must run on the browser's
#  JavaScript thread, and the load command -- if crossing server boundaries --
#  must NOT run on that thread. I have configured the ScriptManager to
#  detect the presence of the word "javascript" followed by a space (exactly that case)
#  and if found, use the JavaScript thread instead of the applet thread.
#    
#  Because it might be useful to combine LOAD and JAVASCRIPT (for the equivalent of a

# new feature: four optional defaults for Van der Waals radii:
#
#  set defaultVDW jmol
#  set defaultVDW rasmol
#  set defaultVDW babel
#  set defaultVDW user
#
# To set the user variety, first set one of the other sets as a basis
# Then add a DATA statement to include the specific elements you want to give
# new radii to:
#
#  set defaultVDW babel;
#  DATA "element_vdw" 6 1.7 END "element_vdw"; 
#  DATA "element_vdw" 6 1.7; 7 1.8 END "element_vdw"; # separate using semicolons or new lines
#
# For full state compatibility, these commands should be given prior to
# model loading, as they affect all calculations involving Van der Waals 
# radii -- except default zoom.
#
# Now select the user set:
#
#  set defaultVDW user
#  spacefill on
#
# To delete all user entries:
#
#  reset VDW 
#
# If user vdw radii are currently set, then this resets the defaults to Jmol.
#
# new feature: show vdw  shows a listing of the currently set VDW radii
#

# stars     50%Babel # percent of Babel standard
# spacefill 5%Rasmol # percent of Rasmol standard
# spacefill 30%User  # percent of User-defined values (or CURRENT if not defined)
# spacefill +1.2     # angstroms added to current vdw scheme
# halos     50%Jmol  # -- halos also have an added bit to make sure they are visible 
# spacefill 250      # RasMol 250 units/Angstrom units still
# spacefill -20      # neg numbers same as percentages: 20% here, using current vdw set
# stars     @{x+0.1} # math OK
# spacefill @x%      # make sure x comes out integer, otherwise % is ignored
#
# note that dots do not have a %Jmol option:

# bug fix for arrows way too fat (introduced in 11.3.19) :(

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.3.19

# bug fix: critical arrow fix of 11.3.17 for 2-point arrows
# bug fix: write PNG default was 0 compression. -q flag was OK for setting 0-9
# bug fix: ragged arrow tip 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.3.18

# critical bug fix for 11.3.17 in regard to serialization of arrays
# also introduces
#
#  reset ALL  # resets all user-created variables
#
# also "exitJmol" typed into the script window for the application does that.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.3.17

# bug fix: problem with unescaping comma-separated point strings "{1,2,3}" as a point.
# bug fix: drawn arrows scale improperly when zooming; arrow heads off-kilter

# new feature: set defaultDrawArrowScale # 0.5 initially
# Drawn arrows now have a head size that can be set and a dimension that
# scales with the model, so arrow head:atom size ratio remains constant
  
#
# new feature: setting Jmol,Rasmol,Shapely,Amino,Roygb,Rwb
# color schemes makes those colors the default colors for these schemes. 

# rename byResidue_jmol --> byResidue_shapely
# rename byResidue_rasmol --> byResidue_amino

# new feature: array variables saved as arrays
# prior to 11.3.17, you could not do:
# 
# x = "this is a test".split(" ")
# y = x[3]
#
# because x was only saved as a string, not an array
# now x is saved as an array, so this is no problem.
#
# new feature Jmol math point(x,y,z) function
#
# point(a,b,c) or point("{x,y,z}")
#
# x = point(y[3], y[6], y[2])
# x = point("{2,3,5}")
#
# needed because, with simple numbers, just
#
# x = {3.0,4.0,5.0} 
#
# works, but 
#
#  x = {r,g,b}
#
# does(did) not.
#
# new feature: Jmol math array element assignment:
#
# a = "2,3,4,5".split(",")
#
# a[3] = "now the 4 becomes this phrase"
# a[a[2]] = "not any more; now it's this"
# a[0] = "setting the final element"
# a[6] = "expanding the array"

#
# works with strings as well:
#
# a = "this is a test"
# a[8] = " not"  
# print a
# >> a = "this is not a test"
#
# new feature: Jmol math x = array(a,b,,,,)

# x = plane("{2,3,5,4}")
# x = plane({_H}[1],{_H}[2],{_H}[3],{_C}[1])
# new feature: print command prints a variable expression
#
# print x
# print x * 3
# print x[4] + x[3]
# print x.split(" ")[2][0]

# new feature: aPlane.distance({some atoms})

#version=11.3.16

# bug fix: Eval RPN processor for list[n] addition operator not doing selection
 
# new feature: MOPAC mgf file UHF orbital reading -- preliminary only

# new feature: byElement and byResidue color schemes allow 
# customized element and residue coloring schemes. 
# built-in include: byElement_Jmol, byElement_Rasmol,
# byResidue_Jmol (shapely) and byResidue_Rasmol (amino) 
# with abbreviations byElement == byElementJmol; byResidue == byResidue_Jmol
# color atoms "byresidue_Jmol"
# 
# Users can set up their own byElement and byResidue color schemes
# simply by preficing a name with "byElement" or "byResidue":
#
# color "byElement_Mine=[x......] [x......] [x......] ..."
#                       0(unknown)    1(H)    2(He) ...
#
# then:
#
# color atoms "byElement_Mine"
#
# RANGE min and max are ignored for byElement and byResidue schemes,
# and there is no scaling done ever, so effectively these prefixes
# make the correlated value a simple index into the array.
# This is what one would want for something that should be a given 
# for a specific element or residue
# 
# Residue indexes in order correspond to the groupID of an atom:
#
#    0  noGroup, 
#    1  ALA, ARG, ASN, ASP, CYS,
#    6  GLN, GLU, GLY, HIS, ILE,
#   11  LEU, LYS, MET, PHE, PRO,
#   16  SER, THR, TRP, TYR, VAL,
#   21  ASX, GLX, UNK,
#   24  A, +A, G, +G, I, +I,
#   30  C, +C, T, +T, U, +U
#
# so this opens the door to user-created residue coloring schemes.
#
# color "byResidue_Mine=[x......] [x......]..."
#                       nogroup   ALA    ...
#
# then

# new feature: {r,g,b} can be used in place of [r,g,b] for indicating color, 
# allowing programmatic color definition:
#
#   r = 255; g = 255; b = 0;
#   background {@r,@g,@b}

# new feature: expanded color command for properties
#
#   color atoms property partialcharge "rwb" range -1.0 1.0
#
# and reverse with range inverted:
#
#   color atoms property partialcharge "rwb" range 1.0 -1.0

# new feature: unlimited user-defined color schemes:
#
#   select none;
#   color "myname=[xff00ff] [xffff00] [xff00ff]"
#
# colors must be [xRRGGBB] format for this one

# new feature: fully remappable isosurface using COLOR command:

# APPLICATION adjustment to console window scaling/size

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.3.13

# this version introduces fully customizable color schemes
#
# new feature: .color for numbers and points delivers the
# color associated with a given value in the current 
# coloring or propertyColorScheme.
# (some number).color gives a color triple as a point {x y z}
# {x y z}.color gives a hexadecimal string [xRRGGBB]
#
#
#  select atomno=3;color yellow
#  x = {atomno=3}.color # gives {255.0, 255.0, 0.0}
#  x = {atomno=3}.color.color # gives "[xFFFF00]"
#
#  set propertyColorScheme "bwr"
#  x = {atomno=3}.partialcharge.color
#
 
# new feature: color ["schemeName"] RANGE [min] [max]
# allows setting of color range and scheme so that color
# values can be determined. This would be used for making
# a color key using positionable ECHO text boxes:
#
#  color "bwr" absolute -0.1 0.1 
#  x = (0.01).color # gives the point-color associated with that number
#  set echo myecho 100 100 # position
#  echo "    " # just some space
#  color echo @x; background echo @x  # color this bar the color of 0.01
#
# new feature: show colorscheme "schemeName"
# delivers "colorscheme = " followed by a string of color values.
# without the scheme name, returns the current colorscheme listing
# For example: show colorscheme "low" delivers:
#
# colorscheme = [xff0000] [xff2000] [xff4000] [xff6000] [xff8000] [xffa000] [xffc000] [xffe000] [xfff000] [xffff00] [xf0f000]
#
# setting an array variable to the color values:
#
#  list = script("show colorscheme \"low\"")[15][0].split(" ") 
#
# new feature: set userColorScheme [list of color names]
# creates a colorscheme referred to as "user" and its reverse, "resu"
# based on a list of color values:
#
#  set userColorScheme red green [x00FFFF] blue
#  color atoms property partialcharge "user" range -1.0 1.0

# new feature: synchronization of applets using JavaScript 
# new feature: synchronization of applets using Jmol scripts:
#
# synchronize .|>|*|appletId[syncId] ON|OFF|SLAVE|command
#
# The synchronize (sync) command allows two or more applets to be synchronized in
# terms of orientation. Move one with the mouse, and the other moves as well.
# In addition, the sync command allows ANY command to be sent to one or more
# other applets directly, without the intervention of JavaScript.
#
# Applets are identified by appletId (jmolApplet0, for instance)
# along with an optional bracketed sync group identifier -- generally a random 
# number that identifies the page containing the controlling applet. If the 
# syncId is not given, then the ID for the page containing the controlling applet
# is used. This feature is important for cross-frame synchronization only. 
#
#
# .          this applet only
# >          all applets except this one
# *          all applets
# appletId   id of a specific applet
# [syncId]   (optional) a unique string of digits -- brackets included
#
# ON         sync as driver (default)
# OFF        turn sync off
# SLAVE      turn sync on, but not as driver
# command    command to send
#
# for example:
#
# sync *   # synchronize all applets as drivers
# sync jmolApplet1  #syncs this applet with jmolApplet1 both as drivers
# sync > "set echo top left;echo OK"  # sends OK to top left of all OTHER applets
# sync jmolApplet2[254678942] OFF  # turns sync off for an applet ON A DIFFERENT PAGE
#                                  # or in a different FRAME
# sync . OFF # turns sync off for this applet
#
# new Jmol.js feature: jmolGetSyncId(); jmolSetSyncId(id);
# allows control over the sync ID via javascript. jmolSetSyncId(id)
# should be called prior to jmolApplet() and should incorporate some sort of
# random digits and no space characters. (A number is good.)
# This should only be necessary for multi-frame pages.

#version=11.1.29

# code: totally reorganized isosurface code; new org/jmol/jvxl packages
#
# adds  (1) isosurface functionxy "file:data.dat" ...
# adds  (2) isosurface functionxy "functionName" {x0 y0 z0} {-ni ...} ...
# adds  (3) isosurface functionxy "functionName" {x0 y0 z0} {-ni ...}{-nj ...} ...
#
# (1) "file:" allows reading of xy data from files for graphing f(x,y)
# (2) ni<0 indicates JavaScript functionName will return a single string that
#     should be parsed for numeric data.
# (3) ni<0, nj<0 indicates that JavaScript will fill the fourth parameter
#     of the function with an array of f[nX][nY] data values:

# adds   applySymmetryToBonds  (default: FALSE)
#
# applySymmetryToBonds 
#
# When set TRUE, this flag instructs Jmol when applying symmetry
# to atoms, as in "load xxx.cif {1 1 1}", to also apply symmetry
# to the bonds indicated in the file. The flag is useful when 
# normal Jmol autobonding would not properly connect atoms, but 
# the model is "molecular" -- the base atom coordinates are correct
# for whole molecules. The flag should NOT be used in cases where
# the application of symmetry operations creates new bonds that 
# were not present in the original set, as for quartz.cif, where
# there is only one bond initially, and after applying symmetry
# new bonds are created that are between atoms that were created
# using two different symmetry operations.

# better isosurface plane rendering, especially in regard to meshes
# bug fix in isosurface contour -n going WAY back to before 10.9.60
# refactoring of all isosurface-related classes

#
# adds isosurface POCKET [cavity] sasurface
# adds isosurface INTERIOR [cavity] sasurface
#
# adds load TRAJECTORY -- for a single file with multiple models all with
# the same number of atoms. Atom locations can also be updated on the
# fly using the data statement. 
#
# adds TRAJECTORY n command -- like FRAME or MODEL, but never more
# than one model at a time displayed, because there is only one set
# of atoms. 
#
# adds script: option for callbacks set from within Jmol. That is, callbacks
# can either be to host page JavaScript functions or to Jmol scripts. This 
# will allow interactive sessions without external JavaScript.
#   
# set pickcallback "script: script doCallback.spt"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.28 

# adds
#

# a = javascript("some javascript")
#
# putting output into a from commands such as "show" or "getProperty", for instance.
#
# reinstates tempManager properly.
#
# adds support for CAChe CSF files with MOPAC (AM1, PM3, etc.),
# Density Functional, and Extended Huckel Gaussian/Slater-based molecular orbitals.
#
# CHANGES DEFAULT RENDERING FOR MOLECULAR ORBITALS TO: MESH NOFILL FRONTONLY
#
# adds MOPAC 2007 graphf output reader (gpt2 files, MOPAC molecular orbitals)
# based on the VERY latest version (not released yet), which includes
# "MOPAC-Graphical data" on the first line, character index 6.
#
# adds 
#
#  mo HOMO [+/- n]
#  mo LUMO [+/- n]
#
# fixes bugs found by FindBugs:
#
# labels:  default z setting for labels (set labelFront, set labelGroup, set labelAtom) 
#          was not being recorded properly
# move:    with slab or zoom was doing integer math
# GhemicalMMReader -- was incorrectly assigning aromatic to bond type 4 via fall-through of switch
#
# adds xodydata reading of "boundary" as unitcell
# enhances default axis rendering for axes unitcell
#
# adds expanded isosurface-related commands:
#
#  draw list
#  isosurface list
#  lcaocartoon list
#  (mo list) -- not particularly useful
#  pmesh list
#
# Listing gives id, number of vertices, number of polygons, visibility,
# and title (usually the command that was given that created this isosurface)
#
# CHANGED BEHAVIOR FOR ISOSURFACE COMMAND WITHOUT ID INDICATED:
#
# Now if no ID is indicated, the previous ID is used for all commands 
# EXCEPT "isosurface delete", which deletes all isosurfaces. 
#
# This is a change from Jmol 10.2 and 11.0, where if you leave
# off the ID, a new isosurface is created.
#
# This was a needed change to prevent unwanted multiple isosurfaces.
#
# CHANGED BEHAVIOR FOR ISOSURFACE DEFAULT COLOR
#
# The default isosurface color no longer changes shade among 5 possible shades.
# That was necessary only because it was easy to mistakenly make multiple
# isosurfaces that otherwise would look the same.

# color axis3 ... 
# color axes ... (of course)
#
# set axis1Color ...
# set axis2Color ...
# set axis3Color ...

# to turn on and off without messing with size, just use
#
# showAxes = true
# showBoundBox = true

# etc.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.19  

# allows comparison of user-defined atom properties in SELECT:

# select property_myprop < 1e-5; 
#
# and 
#
# x = {carbon}[5].property_test

#
# This is it! :)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.18

# introduces user-definable atom properties that can be used

# isosurface variable x   # simple 100% vdw radius mapping
#
# select 1.3
# data "property_myprop @x"
# isosurface property_myprop
#
# allows isosurface mapping of general atom properties:
#
# isosurface sasurface colorscheme bwr map property temperature
#
# adds "bwr" colorscheme as opposed to "rwb", which I think is backward.
#
# isosurface -- now supports APBS (  )
#               molecular electrostatic potential output files
#
# write -- modified to allow unquoted filename in

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.17

# deprecation of SET
# ------------------
#
# The "SET" command is no longer necessary. Anything that could have
# been set using "SET x .... " can now be set using
#
#  x = ....
#
# This allows for a much cleaner interface because we simply make 
# settings in a normal sort of way:
#
# axes on
# axes = molecular
#
# measures = angstroms
#
# It will take a bit more to make it all consistent, but the idea
# is that there are then some special reserved variables that 
# mean something special when set, like "bondmode"
#
# This build allows for the applet to be "bare-bones" -- only the
# essential classes included in the Jar file; others never included
# or possibly in accompanying jar files, such as, perhaps, JmolPopupMenu.jar,
# JmolNavigation.jar, JmolBio.jar, Jm  olSurface.jar, JmolXtal.jar, etc. 
#
# Then a developer can slim down the download. The minimum is 697K, 
# about 58% of the full package. All that gets you is atoms, bonds, 
# and measures.

#
#  x = {*}.bonds.length.max  #the longest bond length
#  x = {*}.atoms.max         #the last atom
#
# 2) extends find() to sets of lines. For example:

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.15:

# APPLICATION: adds undo/redo to a fixed depth of 50 commands
#
# TYPE CONVERSION
#
# We have eight different variable types now:
#    boolean    True/False 
#    integer    0, 1, 2, ....
#    decimal    3.5, 3.25E-3
#    string     "test" "3.5"
#    point      {2.3 3.4 5.6} {0 1/2 1}
#    plane      {0 1 1 0}
#    atomset    {oxygen}
#    bondset    {oxygen}.bonds

# plane and bondset are new; arithmetic operations are not fully developed.

# These can be mixed and matched to good effect. Certain relatively
# intuitive rules apply. Usually the operand on the left sets
# the overall type, allowing for easy type conversion depending upon 
# operand order:
#   int + float:
#     0 + 3.6 ==> 3    (int on left rounds float on right)
#     3.6 + 0 ==> 3.6  (float on left sets result)
#
#   int/float + string:
#     0.0 + "3.5" ==> 3.5 (string converted to float)
#     0 + "3.5"   ==> 3 (string converted to float, then int)
#     "3.5" + 0   ==> "3.50" (integer converted to string)
#     "3.5" + 0.0 ==> "3.50.0" (float converted to string)
#
#     1.0 + {carbon}.xyz     ==> 1 + distance from {0 0 0} to {carbon} center
#     {carbon}.xyz + 1       ==> {carbon} center point offset by {1 1 1}
#
#     x = {carbon}.xyz * {1 0 0} ==> (dot product)
#
#     Now x is the average x coordinate of carbon
#
#  Boolean expressions are a bit different in that the operators 
#  AND, OR, XOR, and NOT all require conversion to boolean UNLESS both
#  operands are atom expressions, in which case these operate directly on the
#  atom sets and return a new atom set, just like in SELECT.
#
#     3 and 0.5  ==> TRUE (both are nonzero)
#     false OR 2.0 ==> true (2.0 is not 0, so it is TRUE)
#     {oxygen} and {molecule=1} ==> all oxygen atoms in the first molecule
#
#     x = ({oxygen} and {molecule=1}).xyz 
#
#     x is now the center point of all oxygen atoms in the first molecule
#
#  In standard math, boolean TRUE evaluates to 1.0; FALSE evaluates to 0.0
#
#     true + 2.0 ==> 3.0 ("TRUE" evaluates to 1.0 in math operations)     
#     2 + true ==> 3 ("TRUE" evaluates to 1.0 and is then turned into an integer)     
#
#
# ATOM EXPRESSION AUTOMATIC DEFINE
#
# When you set a variable to a value, and that value is a point, plane, or atom expression,
# then Jmol automatically registers the result as follows:
#
#  points:
#    x = "{x y z}"
#
#  planes:
#    x = "{x y z w}"
#
#  atom expressions:
#    x = n
#    x_set = "({i j k ...})"
#
# NOTE: "set x" removed in 11.3.40:
# NOTE: _set removed in 11.3.41:
#
#    x = {oxygen}.xyz
#    y = {carbon}.xyz
#    draw @x
#    draw @y
#    draw line1 @x @y
#
#   and
#
#    x = {carbon}[3][5]
#    select @x
#    color green

#    x = {carbon}[3][5]
#    select @x
#    color green

#
#    x = {carbon or oxygen}.bonds
#    select BONDS @x
#    color bonds green

#
# DATA() function and variable option for DATA command
#
# x = data({atomno < 10},"xyz")
# x = data({atomno < 10},"mol")
# x = data({atomno < 10},"pdb")
#
# data "model @x"
#
# write data t.xyz
# write data t.mol
# write data t.pdb
#
#
# Better BITSET implementation 
#
# CHANGE: default string value for a bitset is now the ({n:m})
# string format, which can be used in numerous commands.
#
# To get the count within a string context, just use .size:
#
# x = "number selected is " + {selected}.size
#
# or force integer math:
#
# x = "number selected is " + (0 + {selected})
#
# merges math functions within(), connected(), substructure() into molecular math
#
# adds connected() both for finding atoms and for identifying bonds:
#  xAtoms = connected(3, {carbon})
#  xBonds = connected(1.3,2.5,"single", {carbon} {oxygen})
#
# adds
#  x.atoms
#  to go along with x.bonds   
#
# adds distance({carbon},{oxygen})
# adds angle({carbon}[4],{oxygen}[3], {nitrogen}[2])
#
# angle function accepts from three or four 
# atom expressions or XYZ coordinates and returns a decimal number for
# the distance, angle, or dihedral relating these points. 
# When more than one atom is involved, average positions are used. 
#
# Note that when more than one atom is involved in a set, 
# the following are different:
#
#  x1 = {molecule=1}.distance{molecule=2}
#  x2 = {molecule=1}.xyz - {molecule=2}.xyz
#
#  x1 is a NUMBER that is the "average distance measured 
#     from each molecule 1 atom to the average molecule 2 position"
#  x2 is a point representing the VECTOR from the "average position of molecule 2" 
#     to the "average position of molecule 1"
#
# The following are all equivalent:
#
#  x3 = {molecule=1}.xyz.distance{molecule=2}
#  x4 = 0.0 + ({molecule=1}.xyz - {molecule=2}.xyz)   
#  x5 = ({molecule=1}.xyz - {molecule=2}.xyz).distance{0 0 0}
#  x6 = distance({molecule=1} {molecule=2})
#
#  They are all the distance from the center of molecule 1
#  to the center of molecule 2
#
#
# x = load("filename")
#
# The string data in the file are loaded into the string.
# If the file does not exist, then the string contains the error message.
#
#
# Implements ({i j:k m n}) bitset option across all commands
#
# RESET varName
#
# reset varName  # clears that variable definition
#
#
# "UNSPECIFIED" and "QUADRUPLE" BOND TYPES
#
# An additional bond type is now avaiable: "UNSPECIFIED". 
# This shows up in the MOL2 reader and may be selected for and modified using, for example:
#
#  select connected(unspecified)
#  color bonds red
#
# or
#
#  select connected(unspecified)
#  connect (selected) single modify
#
# In addition, we now can depict quadruple bonds.

# MEASUREMENT FORMAT STRINGS
#
# Measurement format strings can be set using

#
# where the format string may have the following keys:
#
#  %=      1-based index
#  %VALUE  the value of the measurement
#  %UNITS  the units for the measurement

# GETPROPERTY "evaluate"
#
# You can now use getProperty to get expression information directly:
#
#  getproperty "evaluate" "{*}.xyz"
#
# or on a web page the following returns a valid XYZ file for molecule 1:

# SELECTED ATOMS FROM ATOM EXPRESSIONS
#
# You can select atoms from an atom expression using [n]. 
# "[0]" means "and everything after".
#
#  x = {atom expression}[3].ident
#  x = {atom expression}[3][0].xyz   # 3 and after (average position)
#  x = {atom expression}[3][5].x     # 3-5 (average x)

# You can select bonds from an atom expression
#
#  x = {atom expression}.bonds.ident
#  x = {atom expression}.bonds[3].ident

#
# BOND INFORMATION
#
# You can specify how to label a set of bonds using format strings.
# Numbers are currently in Angstroms. Keys are 
#
#  %#      sequential number
#  %=      file 1-based index
#  %ORDER  the bond order
#  %TYPE   the bond type
#  %LENGTH the bond length
#  %x1     atom property "x" for atom 1 
#  %x2     atom property "x" for atom 2
#
# The special atom properties %D1 and %D2 give sequential numbers for the
# atoms FOR THIS SET OF BONDS. This is so that a proper subfile of type MOL
# could be generated.
#
# x = {atom expression}.bonds[3].label("%# %3ORDER %TYPE %a1 %a2 %6.3LENGTH") 
#
#
# EXPANDED MODULUS % OPERATOR IN IF, SET, AND %{}
#
# Usually modulus is reserved for integer math, so we
# extend that here to add some useful "modulus-like" capability:
#
#  string modulus for trimming and padding
#    "test" %3  ==> left trim:  "tes"
#    "test" %6  ==> right pad:  "test  "
#    "test" %-3 ==> right trim: "est"
#    "test" %-6 ==> left pad:   "  test"   
#
#  float modulus for rounding and scientific notation
#    3.5456 %3 ==> "3.546"  (STRING!)
#    3545.6 %-3 ==> "3.55E+3" (STRING!)
#
#    0.0 + 3.5456 %3  ==> 3.546 (float)
#    0.0 + 3545.6 %-3 ==> 3550.0
#
#  point modulus for getting base unit cell equivalent position
#    {3/2 1/2 1/1} % 0 ==> {1/2 1/2 0}
